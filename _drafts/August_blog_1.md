title: "Y Social and Digital Twins"
---

Recently, I've been reading about this new technology called digital twins. I found it to be very exciting, so I want to share some of my thoughts and have a bit of discussion around digital twins. The paper I read on digital twins is the one below. I think it's a great introduction, and it's also the one that my research supervisor has recommended to me to read about digital twins.

As I started reading the paper, and the initial thought before this, I had no idea what a digital twin is. I have not heard of this phrase at all, and the first impression of it was that it could be a clone of something that is online, and it really felt similar to what NFTs are. It's also a digital representation of a real-world physical object, and that was my first impression of what a digital twin could be.

As I continued reading the paper, I found out that no, it's not like that. Digital twins are online objects or online clones of something in the physical world, but there are huge differences. The digital twins are alive, where they gather real-time data from the object or system that it is representing in the real world, so it keeps updating itself. An NFT is just an op; it's something that does not change, and that is one of the key properties of NFTs. Otherwise, NFTs wouldn't exist anymore. But that's for another day to discuss.

Something that is quite talked about on the internet is how digital twins have a use over regular simulations, which is being heavily used in different areas of the world. They have similar features; they both gather data and they both try to simulate what something in the real world or even in the digital world might do. They try to predict the future. Now they are more similar, I think. They have a similar go down inside the real difference here is simulation is where you feed it the data before it starts and try to predict everything afterwards based on the data you feed it. Whereas the digital twin is more of a progression where the digital twin will evolve as the physical twin progresses in the real world. So they are like they're truly like a twin where they grow and they become they crash they do everything basically simultaneously. And that's the thing with the Digital Twin is that you basically get a digital clone of something, a real-time digital clone of something in the real world, whether that is an object, whether that is a system, whether it is anything that has sorts of data that you could replicate in the real world. And basically, that is the real goal of what digital twins are.

On a side note, there seems to be a lot of buzzwords that can be fitted into presenting digital twins in this paper. I've read a lot about AIs, LLMs, machine learning, different models, I've even seen blockchain, security... It seems like potentially could grab the investors' attention one day.

When I was reading the paper on digital twins, I was wondering how this technology would be able to fit within the scope of research that I was doing within this co-op, as the paper's examples of digital twins were all manufacturing-related. After reading the paper below, I realized why my research supervisor wanted me to learn about dictionary systems. Why social, which is talked about in the paper below, is a digital trend platform that replicates an online social media environment.

In short, Y-Social allows users to simulate a social media environment using LLMs. Some of the possible use cases for this would be to simulate political discussions on platforms like Twitter. It does this by utilizing LLM agents to mimic how real-world humans discuss, in this case, political discussions on social media. Thanks to the development of AI, this can be done very easily compared to what it was like a decade ago.

It also is a huge playground for researchers to gain insights into how LLMs are actually performing in trying to mimic humans. By using Wise Social, it allows researchers to gain huge amounts of data and try out different kinds of settings to play around with to see whether the LLMs we have today can actually human-led environment online would look like and to see what kind of different settings they can address in order to achieve different results on potentially different social media platforms. For example, on Instagram, even though it is not strictly the same concept compared to Twitter (where Instagram is more photo and image-based), it is still a very distinct platform compared to Twitter (where Twitter is more opportunity for you to express your feelings). Instagram is more of a record, a place where you keep track of what you have done. You can put all of your photos, you can even put your stories (what your recent activities have been) onto Instagram. By adjusting different sliders and adjusting different personalities, the agents on the Why Social platforms behave. It could potentially be a very powerful tool for researchers to dive into.

I've also tried to play around with Y Social and trying to set it up locally. I have not been too successful with it. I ran across a few problems that I was unable to solve on my own. I am planning to contact the team behind Y Social to see if they would be able to solve any of the problems that I've encountered so wish me luck.

A very strange thing I discovered while trying Y Social is that some of the features on the web dashboard does not seem to work offline, even though it was setup locally, and the LLM connected was also through Ollama. When trying to create the "experiments" and "populations", if there is no network connection, the dashboard would not display the already created ones, instead only showing empty tables. A big todo for me to fully go through the codebase, as Y social is open source, to see where this problem lies.

Looking ahead, something that me and my research supervisor would like to do is try and have Y Social communicate with Mastodon, which is the social media platform that we are focusing on, and

TODO: get clarification on what the goal for connecting YSocial and Mastodon is.

- For the known users, ask in a more polite way.
- send to just first author.

- As we annotate and modify the intervention and privacy measures on Mastodon, see if YSocial agents will be impacted by these changes.
- See if changing the scope of the information they get would change anything.
- in basic, different kinds of experiments that would unlikely be able to be ran on humans.
- test whether some of the features are actually related to privacy,
    - e.g., ip address is more about integrity control and resource limits rather than privacy.
    - social choices that have technical implications, and vice versa.
