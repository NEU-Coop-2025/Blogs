# Exploring Algorithms on Social Media

When I was first starting to use social media, I started wondering how these platforms were able to give me exactly what I wanted to see, whether it's through TikTok or Douyin (the equivalent of TikTok in China). As I started scrolling through the videos, even though I didn't like any of the videos and I didn't follow any people on the platform, it still knew what I wanted to see just by analyzing how I was watching each video. That is truly alarming, and you might have the same thought.

This is not by chance; it's engineered to be that way. It's the algorithms behind those platforms that make you trapped in your little bubble. And it's the big corporations behind these platforms that don't want you to go anywhere and they are willing to do anything for you to stay.

Take Twitter for example, or X now they call it. We don't actually control what we see on the platform. On the surface, it might seem like we do, I mean, the platform can't force us to follow other people or interact with certain posts, right? Well, they do control a majority of it.

Once you have had enough time on the platform, you have had enough interactions with other people (through following, liking, commenting, reposting) - all these sort of actions on the platform. The company behind that platform will be able to gain enough data and information back to you for their algorithm to give you a feed that exactly what you want to see that makes you want to stay on this platform more. In return, they get to gather even more data and information about you as a user. This creates what's called a "vicious cycle".

These algorithms are deeply harmful for the users, and especially for those younger age users. I am aware that the platforms have created multiple kinds of under 18 or under certain age restrictions and policies that make the experience different for them. However, as far as my knowledge is concerned, their experience with these social media platforms is still hugely impacting their minds and their experiences growing up, which is extremely different than what the previous generations have been through. I don't want to say that one of them is better or worse, each generation has its struggles and benefits, but in terms of the status quo, social media has undoubtedly become the biggest challenge in terms of them having a good environment to grow up in.

Think about the way we use social media. Picking up the phone first thing in the morning and hop on social media to see if there is a reply from our fans or our friends. We see what is trending nowadays, then we do what they typically do in the morning routine. The last thing we do before sleep is scrolling through social media to see what we have missed throughout the day. What's even worse is the amount of options we can choose from, ranging from texts on Twitter to picutres on Instagram to short form videos on Tiktok to long form videos on Youtube. What this creates is a non-stop bubble for the users to explore through. Even though it technically allows users to "explore the world without stepping out of their bedrooms", it actually prevents them from actually exploring the world around them.

Back in the web 1.0 age, it was very different from what the web is now. I am not the most qualified person on this platform to talk about the old ages, but as far as I am aware, the internet was a relatively free place where the user themselves can decide what they want to see. Although there are lots of caveats that come along with that, such as the convenience and usability of the internet and platforms, the users still had more control over what they wanted to see. Nowadays, the algorithms feed you what they know that you want to see, and to be honest, it does create such convenience that is unparalleled with what internet used to be. These data that the company has gathered knows even more about you than you do, and if you think about it, that is a very scary fact.

The deep cost / deep root cause behind that is these algorithms created by these big corporations behind those platforms that just trap the users into their platform. And for the big corporations, there are so many incentives and not enough regulations that prevents them from using and abusing these kinds of algorithms to trap their users in. These corporations know that in order for the users to stay, they have to be different or at least different from what social media and other internet platforms used to be.

These corporations obviously they want to get as much data about you as possible.There's infinite incentives to do that, especially in the U.S. where there's almost nothing that prevents them from gathering all the data they know about you. Usually, that comes with zero or very low state consequences.

With those data about you, they can use that data and train their model to either for their own benefit or to feed you better content which might seem like a benefit for consumers at first glance, but the palm of using social media over excessively is going to be a huge it's going to harm it's going to harm the users, and there is no denying that.

People have started to fight this. Companies like Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook (now Meta) have been sued.

- I am unsure of the precise way to cite information from online in blogs like these.

However, the amount that the company has been either regulated or fined by is not equivalent to the benefits that they are getting from doing this. In terms of the trade-off, it's clear to see why these corporations keep acting the same way.

Now, an alternative to this would be a social media platform like Mastodon, where at least the majority of the experiences you have would be clear of the algorithms that you see on the traditional big tech social media platforms. Most of the time the posts will be strictly you are shown are from the people you follow and only in reverse chronological order, without any sophisticated algorithms that tries to benefit high interaction toots. There is a place where you will see posts based on the algorithms that Mastodon has, but it is extremely different from the ones that big traditional social media platforms give you.

But the solution would be to get rid of algorithm forever, which would allow the users to be on social media less and the overall screen time to go down by a huge amount as well.

Imagine a world where algorithms didn't exist. Imagine a world where people would not be on their phones all day and actually come out to play and have fun. And I know that world existed before, but right now I am not seeing this. Maybe it's me being addicted to social media that makes me be on my phone for way too long, but most likely it's these big corporations that have ruined humanity for their own good.

Now they do have their reasons for doing this. They gained so much money all these years and no one is there to stop them because no one's - not enough people see the reason to do so. I hope that people realize one day that this kind of phenomenon has to stop. People need to put down their phones, put down screen time, put down their laptops and actually come back to the real world. Not just for the sake of privacy, not just for the sake of getting rid of social media, but for our health and for a better life.

All these times that we've been on social media they've taken way too much of our lives for just a quick giggle, and that's honestly sad. And this has to be changed fundamentally on a deeper level. Because these users don't stand a chance against the big corps. We won't be able to stand the convenience, we won't be able to stand all these easy-to-use, fun little apps on our phones that brings so much joy that it makes us forget how stressful a day of work has been. Otherwise, the world would've woken up already instead of being addicted to all these social media platforms. But that is not the case. Human self-control will not be able to withstand all these algorithms. The change has to come from somewhere else.
